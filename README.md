Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning on a dataset provided, focusing on Exploring the Relationship between variables and Identifying the patterns and trends in the Data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is <a href="https://github.com/AvanishVerma1703/PRODIGY_DS_02/blob/main/test.csv">Titanic_dataset</a>. This repository contains the Titanic dataset, which includes passenger information from the ill-fated Titanic voyage. The dataset features attributes such as passenger demographics, ticket details, and survival status. 

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization



## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualization**: Created a Histogram Plot, Count Plot, Scatter Plot to Explore the Relationship between Variables and Identify Patterns and Trends in Data. 



## Conclusion

In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the factors influencing passenger survival. By analyzing the data, researchers and practitioners can explore patterns and trends, enhancing understanding of historical events and improving predictive modeling techniques in data science.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
